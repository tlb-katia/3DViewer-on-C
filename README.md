# 3D-Viewer-on-C

## Implementation of 3D Viewer.

A program to visualise 3D wireframe models.

## Usage :

- To install the app run `make install`
- To open app run `make open`
- To see tests run `make test`, might need to install `check`
- To see tests code coverage run `make gcov_report`, might need to install `lcov`
- To uninstall the app run `make uninstall`
